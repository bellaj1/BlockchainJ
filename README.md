bitcoinj java 'insufficient priority' (66) issue:
It seems that technical info is not up to date to the current Bitcoin Core version (0.11.2.0). Since version 0.11 (12 July 2015) the minimum relay fee is 5 times bigger (from 1000 Satoshi to 5000) so the transaction has not enough fees to be relayed.
